# Data-Mining-Project-2014-
This repository contains my files for the project for my academic course "Data Mining". The project pertains to clustering using the K-Means Clustering Algorithm.

The main aim of the project is to learn about clustering and apply K-Means Clustering Algorithm to cluster the Data.
The Data includes the results of vaious Tennis Matches of major Tournaments. Firstly, we applied Feature Reduction to reduce the fields of the data and then applied K-Means Algorithm.

The prequisite for the program to run are:
1) Hadoop 2.3.0
2) Multinode Clustering setup on all the node

The program run and divide the data set into 3 cluster accordingly:-
1) Low Winning Chances
2) Middle Winning Chances
3) High Winning Chances
